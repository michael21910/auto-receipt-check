# Auto Receipt Check
This program web crawlers the receipt prize number in [this webpage](https://invoice.etax.nat.gov.tw/).  
Then, prepare the "receipt.txt" file with this python file in the same folder.  
index.py will output a dataframe, telling you the final checking result.  
  
## Small story :speech_balloon:
I think that checking receipts by human is such a waste of time.  
Thus, I wrote a program to solve this problem.  
  
## Things you need to do :open_book:

* Install the library "pandas"
```
pip install pandas
```
* Install the library "requests"
```
pip install requests
```
* Install the library "BeautifulSoup"
```
pip install BeautifulSoup
```
* Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/michael21910/auto-receipt-check.git
```
* Prepare a txt file called "receipt.txt" and input the receipt numbers you have. Something like this:

* Add this file with "index.py" in the same folder
* Execute the program file "index.py"
  
## What will you get :icecream:
A DataFrame that shows the receipt in txt file and the price you get.  
  
## Demo :eyes:
* oops, unfortunate.
